                <p>The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were eight international 
                   development goals for the year 2015 that had been established following 
                   the Millennium Summit of the United Nations in 2000, following the 
                   adoption of the United Nations Millennium Declaration. These were based 
                   on the OECD DAC International Development Goals agreed by Development 
                   Ministers in the "Shaping the 21st Century Strategy". The Sustainable 
                   Development Goals (SDGs) succeeded the MDGs in 2016.</p>

                   <p>
                    Each goal had specific targets, and dates for achieving those targets. 
                    The eight goals were measured by 21 targets. To accelerate progress, 
                    the G8 finance ministers agreed in June 2005 to provide enough funds<br>
                    to the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the 
                    African Development Bank (AfDB) to cancel $40 to $55 billion in 
                    debt owed by members of the heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) 
                    to allow<br> them to redirect resources to programs for improving 
                    health.

        <p> Bangladesh Progress Report 2015' is the eighth report monitoring the progress of MDGs in Bangladesh after 2005. The report shows that Bangladesh has registered remarkable progresses in the areas of poverty alleviation, ensuring food security, primary school enrolment, gender parity in primary and secondary level education, lowering the infant and under-five mortality rate and maternal mortality ratio, improving immunization coverage; and reducing the incidence of communicable diseases.

            challenges also. The existence of poverty pockets, prevalence of

                universal access to reproductive health and resource constraints

            Globally, the number of deaths of children under 5 years of age fell from 12.7 million in 1990 to 6.3 million in 2013.
            In developing countries, the percentage of underweight children under 5 years old dropped from 28% in 1990 to 17% in 2013.
            Globally, new HIV infections declined by 38% between 2001 and 2013.<br>

            Existing cases of tuberculosis are declining, along with deaths among HIV-negative tuberculosis cases.
            In 2010, the world met the United Nations Millennium Development Goals target on access to safe drinking-water, as measured by the proxy indicator of access to improved
             drinking-water sources, but more needs to be done to achieve the sanitation target.
